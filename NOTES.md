## Useful coding stuff
* Best way for counting occurences:
  active = {}
  for a in self.getActive(type):
    active[a.getName()] = active.get(a.getName(), 0) + 1

## Relevant comments from devs
# General
* [20:27] Oeller: Poison has less effect on bosses. Does that apply only for the built-in shred or also for 20 DoT damage? Not clear in the game guide.
In addition. Is the shred from poison as well limited by 20 stacks? Or is it possible top have poison shred stack to 20 alongside additional poison stack to further reduce the resistance?
[20:41] Mike W: built in shred only; not limited

* [21:20] Mike W: poison shred is limited to 20. the resistance drop from poison itself isn't limited

* [03:50] Hishoukitai: the 40% reduced ailment chance on hit with Sentinel's Warpath, is that a flat 40%? for example if i have 200% ignite does it drop it to 160% or is it 40% of that 200%, dropping it to 120%?
[04:13] Trasochi: It's multiplicative so if you have 200% chance it drops to 120%.

* [09:20] Oeller: Since Manifest Strike has no tooltip: What are the scaling tags? Any Attributes?
[20:45] Mike W: Physical, Melee, Strength and Attunement.

* [21:12] sir.hrsT: hello quick question : how is the interaction between Rive nodes "Execution" and "Savagery" for the third hit. Does the third Hit gets the dmg amp from hitting an ignited target and THAN consumes the ingnite to boost phys dmg or does it consume the ignite and doesnt get any boost from "Savagery"?
[21:24] Mike W: The bonus damage from hitting an ignited target gets calculated first then it consumes the ignite.

* [01:13] Oeller: Is the Attackspeed of all Rive attacks 0.68182? Only info I found about attack speed in this thread. Posted by Trasochi in 2019...
[01:15] Trasochi: The first two parts of Rive's combo are 25% faster than a basic attack and the last is 7% faster.

* [23:16] Oeller: What is the attack time of Serpent Strike? According to my current simulations it seems to hit faster than every 0.68182s. More like 0.6 * 0.68182s per attack. And what about swipe. Do you mind sharing these information?
Nevermind. The discrepancy seems to be related to Venomous Intent from Serpent Strike. It gives the skill a chance to proc Poison Spit but says nothing about the proc chance. Any information? An additional question regarding this: Although it does no hit damage it is assumed to be a spell hit and will apply bleed etc if provided by 'bleed on Hit', doens't it?
[00:35] Mike W: Poison spells don't apply those things generally. It typically requires a damage hit to apply effects like bleed chance.
[00:35] Mike W: That's why serpent strike has base physically damage
[00:36] Mike W: I don't go those numbers on mobile sorry.
[00:42] Oeller: I'm just confused by the wording on Poison Spit: 'a projectile spell that poisons on hit,  'the poisoning projectile inflicts poison on hit [...] the projectile does not deal any other damage on hit'.
So it only applies an additional poison on hit and procs no other on Hit effects as they need damaging hits?
[00:42] Mike W: Unless that one specifically has something extra set up for it that I don't remember, yes.
[00:44] Oeller: Thanks. So it probably provides only a marginal damage increase even if it procs on every hit (no chance specified). Wording could be improved. I will make a suggestion.
[00:46] Mike W: Every application of poison reduces the target's poison resistance. So it does have a multiplicative damage increase with your other poison applications.
[00:47] Oeller: Yes. But it has inherent duration reduction of 0.35; considering DR  of penetration for a lot of stacks it is probably not the best. Poison/ailment Duration could provide a better scaling

# EQ and Aftershock
* [16:31] Oeller: What are the damage effectiveness and attributes for Earthquake Aftershock? 300% like the initial hit? The skilltree does nowhere provide the skill when pressing alt. Already opened a bugreport.
[17:09] Mike W: The initial hit is 350%
The aftershocks are 100%
Strength and Attunement Damage 4%
* [22:14] Trasochi: Yeah the ticks don't deal a constant amount of damage. So for example, if ticks happened every 1 second and an ailment lasted 2.5 seconds and dealt a total of 10 damage, it would deal 4 damage with the first tick, 4 damage with the second tick, and 2 damage immediately when it expired. If you increase the duration by 10%, so that it lasts 2.75 seconds and deals a total of 11 damage it would deal 3 damage immediately when it expires.
