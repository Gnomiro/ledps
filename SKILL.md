# HowTo
* todo

# ToDos
* Sparsify onHit- and trigger-Loops
  * Stats should only keep '!=0' information and provide them to skill
* Manifest Strike:
  * Scales with strength? Currently not accounted for
* Warpath:
  * Talents
  * Reduce onHit chance for ailments only, i.e., shred and ailments. currently for all onHit non-trigger effects
* Default attack routine:
  * Change order of duration and stats later to match class implementations
  * Make duration and stats a requirement?
* Skill provided global buffs like drainingAssault from warpath -> \_globalSkillStats or buff?
  * Probably set a channeld-buff on attack which is overriden by similar skills?
* Default getAttacktime:
  * tempStats: Add stats per global add from Character/Environment or just pass it always?
* More skills
* Full multi-target support (probably never two enemies but at least consistent scaling for all buffs/debuffs) -> Move enemy number into Enemy-class
