# todo:
# melee skills with modifiers 
# -> buffs especially for something like rive execution; scale linear with number of target instead of 
# simulating multiple targets
# buffs <-> ailments like 'shred' with different type like 'buff' and 'element' for increases, maybe 'generic'
# should be treated like an 'element' for this purpose
# maybe: rename 'ailment' to 'duration' with types 'damagingAilment', 'ailment', 'buff', 'shred'. 'debuff'
# maybe: store ailments <-> duration in seperate containers based on type

# if dots really snapshot damage calculation besides shred must be moved to each
# single ailment on creation instead of tick! -> shoudl even be more efficient!
# shred and other debuffs still on per tick base as it depends on debuffs on enemy?

# divine bolt on hit; same target? doesnt seem so
# manifest strike on hit
# axe thrower; same target? - seems so
